My name is Atharva Nagesh Jade. I was born in Solapur did my schooling from Satara. Afterward, completed HSC and B.Tech from Solapur and earned a B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering from DBATU with an 8.5 CGPA.Now currently I am pursuing PG Diploma in BDA at CDAC Kharghar.

During my second year of B.Tech, I worked on a SQL mini-project that analyzed Instagram users'.While completing this project I got an idea about how a data analyst work on real time data and take data driven decisions. Some of other projects were IMDB movie Analysis and Datamart tableau dashboard.

One of my key strengths is my adaptability, which has helped me flourish in diverse environments and challenges. While I sometimes tend to focus on multiple tasks at once, I am actively working on improving my time management by planning tasks more effectively to ensure accuracy and efficiency

Apart from my academics, I have a passion for trekking and photography, which has deepened my appreciation for nature and sharpened my attention to detail.

In the short term, my goal is to secure a reputable position in a company where I can apply my skills and contribute to impactful projects. In the long term, I aspire to take my parents on international travels and make them proud by achieving success in my career.
